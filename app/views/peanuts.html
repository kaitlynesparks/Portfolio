				<p>The peanuts project explored people requesting help online and those stepping up to meet those needs. For our Social Web class at Carnegie Mellon, we researched what motivated people to give and how we could help built trust between those requesting help online and those giving. After doing research, we created a web application to implement the things we discovered. If the project continued, we would use this to perform additional research to test our findings.</p>

				<p>There are a multitude of places popping up on the internet for the purpose of eliciting and receiving help. Some of these are stand alone sites and others are communities within social sites, such as Reddit. When people are requesting monetary help online, many requests state that the requestor has helped others in the past or plans to help others in the future as part of the description. People that are donating frequently seek validation of who the requestor is from their activity on the site. However, there is no provided way for requestors to prove their previous donations or for those planning to give to see that activity. We wanted to research how a website could give requestors the ability to track their reciprocity, which we defined as the relationship between a user's giving and receiving. We also wanted to see if there was an impact on donations if this information was visible. We predicted that showing reciprocity would allow donors to quickly trust requestors which would help them make quicker decisions about donating and influence the amount they gave.</p>

				<p>We were originally inspired by reading a paper regarding which posts on the subreddit r/RAOP (Random Acts of Pizza) were the most successful. We decided to look into other sites online where people were requesting assistance. We explored a few different online communities and noticed some common things:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>People are using online sources to request help from strangers.</li>
					<li>Strangers are willing to fulfill requests.</li>
					<li>Requesters tend to tell their stories and try to offer some sort of verification that their stories are true.</li>
					<li>Requesters frequently promise to help someone else in the future or state instances where they have helped in the past.</li>
					<li>Donors will ask for more details or proof before being willing to give.</li>

				<p>We began by reading research papers on altruism, motivation, and microvoluntering. One of the papers that we read was an in-depth look at the aspects of a request on the subreddit r/RAOP. They showed that certain information would influence the success of the request. We began looking at r/RAOP and noticed that there were other subreddits where people made requests for help. We analysed their requests and how potential donors responded to common themes. After reviewing a few subreddits and other request websites, we decided to look at how showing reciprocity impacts peopleâ€™s donations.</p>

				<p>To quickly explore how various representations of reciprocity would influence behavior, we created a survey showing 8 different requests with the same story, but different reciprocity statements. The survey was distributed to 83 different people we recruited from friends and family. We asked to which of the 8 requests they would be most likely to donate. After the survey, we also got some feedback from participants to understand the reasoning behind their choices.</p>

				<!--<p>After analyzing the results of the first survey and the feedback we received, we decided to use two of the top four statements to test further. In the first survey, all of the statements showed more giving than receiving, but we also wanted to test whether a positive reciprocity or a negative reciprocity statement would be more likely to get donations. We created a survey to test this and received 276 responses on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We randomly showed each Turk worker the request and then one visualization of reciprocity or a control showing only the request. We asked how much they would donate, and also recorded the amount of time it took them to answer. The only statistically significant result we found was those who donated spent longer thinking about their decision and as time increased, dollar amount increased as well. We also saw that people generally gave more to people who had given less than they received. The statement "Martin has given to 20 people and received donations from 50 people" (3rd card below) was most likely to receive higher amounts of money.</p> -->

				<p>We used the results from our first survey to create visualizations of different ways of showing reciprocity. We also wanted to test whether people were more likely to give more to someone who had given more than they had received (positive reciprocity) or to someone who had received more than they had given (negative reciprocity). We created a survey and got 276 responses on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. For our survey, we randomly showed each Turk worker the request and then one visualization of reciprocity or a control showing only the request. We asked how much they would donate, and also recorded the amount of time it took them to answer.</p>

				<p>Most of our results were not statistically significant. The statistically significant results were:  
					<ul>
						<li>Those who donated spent longer thinking about their decision.</li>
						<li>The longer people thought about their decision, the more they donated.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Other results include:
					<ul>
						<li>People gave more to those who had given less than they had received.</li>
						<li>The statement "Martin has given to 20 people and received donations from 50 people" (third card below) was most likely to receive higher amounts of money. </li>
