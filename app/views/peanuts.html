<!--About the Project-->
<div class="row">
	<div class="col col-md-12">
		<p><span class="category">Assignment:</span> Pick any topic related to social web and explore it with design, research, and/or development.
		<br/><br/>	
		<span class="category">Opportunity:</span> When people are requesting monetary help online, many requests state that the requestor has helped others in the past or plans to help others in the future as part of the description. People that are donating frequently seek validation of who the requestor is from their activity on the site. However, there is no provided way for requestors to prove their previous donations or for those planning to give to see that activity.
		<br/><br/>
		<span class="category">Solution:</span> We wanted to research how a website could give requestors the ability to track their reciprocity, which we defined as the relationship between a user's giving and receiving. We also wanted to see if there was an impact on donations if this information was visible. We predicted that showing reciprocity would allow donors to quickly trust requestors which would help them make quicker decisions about donating and influence the amount they gave.</p>

		    	We began by reading research papers on altruism, motivation, and microvoluntering. One of the papers that we read was an in-depth look at the aspects of a request on the subreddit r/RAOP. They showed that certain information would influence the success of the request. We began looking at r/RAOP and noticed that there were other subreddits where people made requests for help. We analysed their requests and how potential donors responded to common themes. After reviewing a few subreddits and other request websites, we decided to look at how showing reciprocity impacts peopleâ€™s donations.

		    	We wanted to quickly explore what possible representations of reciprocity would influence people's behaviors. So we created a survey that showed 8 different requests with the same story but different reciprocity statements. The survey was distributed to 83 people that we recruited from friends and family. We asked which of the 8 requests they would be most likely to donate to. After the survey, we also got some feedback from participants to understand the reasoning behind their choices.

<!--Final Survey-->

			<div class="panel-body">
		    	After analyzing the results of the first survey and the feedback we received, we decided to use the two of the top four statements to test further. In the first survey, all of the statements showed more giving than receiving, but we also wanted to test whether a positive reciprocity or a negative reciprocity statement would be more likely to get donations. We created a survey to test this and got 276 responses on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We randomly showed each Turk worker the request and then one visualization of reciprocity or a control that only showed the request. We asked how much they would donate, and also recorded the amount of time it took them to answer. The only statistically significant result that we found was that those who donated spent longer thinking about their decision and as time increases, dollar amount increased as well. But we also saw that people generally gave more to people that had given less than they received. The statement "Martin has given to 20 people and received donations from 50 people" (3rd card below) was most likely to receive higher amounts of money.

		    	We wanted to see what it would look like to apply the results of our surveys, so we created a microcharity website that showed reciprocity. As a team, we determined the concepts for the website, but the development was done by Jeff and Jim. If this had been a longer project, we wanted to use this website to conduct experiments to test what people do with actual money.
