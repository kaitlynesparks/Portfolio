				<p>When student developers are working on assignments, there are multiple sources that they have to reference including textbooks, assignment sheets, powerpoints, internet articles, and scratch paper. Application switching presents opportunities for other distractions to catch their attention. For our User Centered Research and Evaluation class at CMU, we performed the contextual design methodology as described by Karen Holtzblatt to envision a solution.</p>

				<p>Developers struggle to pay attention to their work, especially student developers. It's easy to get distracted on a computer. We also noticed that developers heavily depend on outside resources and spend significant time switching between applications to access those resources. For our User Centered Research and Evaluation class at CMU, we performed the contextual design methodology as described by Karen Holtzblatt on student developers. Synthesizing that research, we discovered that distraction and application switching were two of the biggest problems they faced. We envisioned a solution that will lock down the coding environment to prevent distraction while improving the way that students view outside resources. </p>
