				<p>Developers struggle to pay attention to their work, especially student developers. It's easy to get distracted on a computer. We also noticed that developers heavily depend on outside resources and spend significant time switching between applications to access those resources. For our User Centered Research and Evaluation class at CMU, we performed the contextual design methodology as described by Karen Holtzblatt on student developers. Synthesizing that research, we discovered that distraction and application switching were two of the biggest problems they faced. We envisioned a solution that will lock down the coding environment to prevent distraction while improving the way that students view outside resources. </p>

				<p>We began by performing contextual interviews with student developers. Each team member interviewed one developer for a total of 5 interviews. During interviews, we went to the location where the developers normally worked and observed them working on their own assignments. Because these were contextual interviews, we did not come with specific questions to ask. Instead, we assumed the role of an apprentice learning from a master. By doing this, we got to see the truth about what happens and not just what the interviewee remembered and thought was important. We took notes during the interview to use later during interpretation sessions.</p>

The interviewer read her notes aloud and the rest of the team worked on creating the flow model and the sequence model. We also created notes about interesting things, breakdowns, and design ideas that would be used later to create the affinity diagram.</p>

				<p>After consolidating the models, we began visioning. We revisited our affinitiy diagram and models. For each, we generated design ideas and determined the key problems we needed to address. Then we listed the technologies we had available to us to solve the problems. While looking at our models and technologies list, we began visioning by sketching out possible scenarios in an improv-style session with one person being the writer and the other team members speaking their ideas aloud.</p>
