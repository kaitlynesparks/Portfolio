<!--About Project -->
<div class="row">
	<div class="col col-md-12">
		<p><span class="category">Assignment:</span> Conceive of an original mobile application that provides tools and/or information to an ambulance driver accessing the application while on the job.
		<br/><br/>	
		<span class="category">Opportunity:</span> EMS workers have a uniquely stressful job and do not have a lot of opportunity or encouragement to learn life skills or additional job skills. However, they have a lot of downtime that can be used more effectively.
		<br/><br/>
		<span class="category">Solution:</span> An application that provides facts about topics such as mental health, nutrition, and driving skills. Leaders can set up friendly competitions about the facts for members of the squad. This promotes team bonding and provides visibility of hard work to management.</p>

		    	We started this project by researching the experience and needs of emergency medical staff. We read through internet blogs and articles, watched ambulance ride along videos, and interviewed an EMT to get an understanding of the life and work circumstances for a professional in the emergency medical services field.

		    	We generated concept ideas for apps and created an affinity diagram. The process of creating the affinity diagram allowed us to talk about the ideas as a team, and we later used the affinity diagram to to see ideas that we could combine into cohesive, larger concepts. After that, we sorted them into an feasibility-impact matrix showing the potential usefulness of the application against the difficulty of creating it. Personas were provided for us, and we used these to determine which ideas to pursue. We picked our top four choices and composed narratives about their use based on our personas. We used these narratives to make the selection for our final idea. We also followed up with the EMT that we interviewed initially to ask additional questions to make sure our idea was useful and desirable.

				We fleshed out our idea using a navigation map, which we used this to think through the functionality of our app and the interaction that would be need to move between different functions. Through our navigation map, we were able to quickly analyze the breadth and depth of our application. We initially created it using screen names. As we progressed through our design process, we maintained our navigation map and kept checking that breadth and depth was appropriate. In updating, we also replaced key screen with sketches, low-fidelity mockups, and high-fidelity mockups. This was helpful for us because it was natural for the complexity of our application to increase as we thought about it more; however, we wanted to keep it simple. Using the navigation map, we were able to see when we needed to reconsider features and scale back.

				As we went through the design process, we made increasingly more detailed designs. We began with sketches, then did low-fidelity mockups, and finally did high-fidelity mockups. To create mockups, we used Adobe Illustrator. We went through multiple iterations of high-fidelity mock-ups trying to get the right color palette and feel for our application. We originally had a look and feel that was inspired by ambulances. We had red and blue as our primary colors and had straight lines. However, we later decided that we wanted a more playful and lighthearted theme. EMTs see ambulances all the time and they are likely a stressful place for them, so we didn't want to remind them of that. We wanted to give them an application that was enjoyable for them and would help to alleviate some of their stress.

						The final designs for our screens included a fun, playful color scheme. We also introduced an owl character that provided consistency and whimsy throughout encouraging users to continue using the application. These features provided a feeling that will be a welcome relief from the seriousness of the users' normal work days.
