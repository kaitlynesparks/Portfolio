		<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Conceive of an original mobile service that provides tools and/or information to an ambulance driver accessing information while on the job.
		<br/><br/>	
		<strong>Opportunity:</strong> EMS workers have a uniquely stressful job and do not have a lot of opportunity or encouragement to learn life skills or additional job skills. However, they have a lot of downtime that can be used more effectively.
		<br/><br/>
		<strong>Solution:</strong> An app that provides facts about topics such as mental health, nutrition, and driving skills. Leaders can set up friendly competitions about the facts for members of the squad. This promotes team bonding and provides visibility of hard work to management.</p>
