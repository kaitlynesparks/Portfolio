		<p><span class="category">Assignment:</span> Conceive of an original mobile service that provides tools and/or information to an ambulance driver accessing information while on the job.
		<br/><br/>	
		<span class="category">Opportunity:</span> EMS workers have a uniquely stressful job and do not have a lot of opportunity or encouragement to learn life skills or additional job skills. However, they have a lot of downtime that can be used more effectively.
		<br/><br/>
		<span class="category">Solution:</span> An app that provides facts about topics such as mental health, nutrition, and driving skills. Leaders can set up friendly competitions about the facts for members of the squad. This promotes team bonding and provides visibility of hard work to management.</p>

		    	We started this project by researching the experience and needs of emergency medical staff. We read through internet blogs and articles, watched ambulance ride along videos, and interviewed an EMT.
		    	<blockquote>
  					<p>“Myself and many of my co-workers have sought grief counseling, nutrition assistance, and some have even been placed on heavy sleep medications because they never had [targeted information] available to them in a more private medium.”</p>

		    	We generated concept ideas for apps and created an affinity diagram.  After that, we used sorted them into an feasibility-impact matrix.
		    	<br/><br/>
		    	Personas were provided for us.  We used these to determine which ideas to pursue.  We picked the four top choices and composed narratives about their use based on our personas. We used these narratives to make the selection for our final idea, 
		    	<br/><br/>
				We also followed up with the EMT that we interviewed initially to ask additional questions to make sure our idea was useful and desirable.

				We fleshed out our idea using a navigation map.  We used this to think through the functionality of our app and the interaction that would be need to move between different screens. We also determined the appropriate depth and breadth of the navigation. We then created sketched wireframes for our main screens and placed them on our navigation map. We continued to update it as we iterated our designs.

				For iterations, we did sketches, then we did digital low-fidelity mock ups. We went through multiple iterations of high-fidelity mock-ups. We originally had a color scheme and feel that was inspired by ambulances. We had red and blue as our primary colors and had straight lines. However, we later decided that we wanted a more playful and lighthearted theme. EMTs see ambulances all the time and they are likely a stressful place for them many times, so we didn't want to remind them of that. We wanted to give them an application that was enjoyable for them and would help to lift some of their stress.
