		<p><span class="category">Assignment:</span> Design a personal website home page for desktop and mobile platforms. 
		<br/><br/>	
		<span class="category">Design Overview:</span> The focus of this design was to create a webpage and a mobile page with a cohesive look and feel across the two mediums. First, I focused on finding appropriate content for a professional, personal webpage. I chose to keep the design very simple so the important elements were easy to find and consume. Additionally, to create consistency, I paid attention to making the information heirarchy the same across the two screens.</p>

<!--Sketch Wireframes-->
<div class="row">
	<div class="col col-md-12">
		<h4>Sketch Wireframes</h4>
		<p>The first step was to determine the content that was needed for this type of website and make sketch wireframes. While making these sketches, I focused on making the heirarchy consistent across the mobile and desktop versions of the website. I also concentrated on making the most important aspects of the website higher in the heirarchy. I decided that if someone was visiting a page like this, they would want to know who it was about, their title, and how to contact them; so I made that information easy to find at a glance. I also wanted it to be easy to look through examples of work and see a summary about the person, so I included that information on the home screen in the forms of a carousel showing work and a brief summary paragraph. I created 5 sketches of possible layouts and then picked the aspects I liked from each one to create a final sketch and use in future iterations.</p>

<!--Digital Sketches and Low Fidelity Mockups-->

		<h4>Digital Sketeches and Low Fidelity Mockups</h4>
		<p>After getting feedback from the class on the sketches, I moved to a digital sketch that was exactly the same as the final paper sketch. After getting my idea into a digital version and seeing it at a more realistic size and ratio, I was able to iterate to a low fidelity black and white mockup.</p>

<!--High Fidelity Mockups-->
<div class="row">
	<div class="col col-md-12">
		<h4>High Fidelity Mockups</h4>
		<p>The next step I took was to convert the black and white mock up into a color mock up. I played with a few color schemes based on the low fidelity mock up. However, once I added color, I realized it felt very heavy. So I removed a lot of the color in favor of a very simple final design. For this type of website, I felt that the content needed to be more prominent than colors or dominating design elements.</p>
