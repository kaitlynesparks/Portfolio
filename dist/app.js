We also noticed that developers heavily depend on outside resources and spend significant time switching between applications to access those resources. For our User Centered Research and Evaluation class at CMU, we performed the contextual design methodology as described by Karen Holtzblatt on student developers. Synthesizing that research, we discovered that distraction and application switching were two of the biggest problems they faced. We envisioned a solution that will lock down the coding environment to prevent distraction while improving the way that students view outside resources. </p>\n" +

This app is intended to help busy people, like college students or young professionals, that donât like to eat alone. This app allows you to choose a time and place to eat and then push that notification to your social feeds so that your friends can join you for a meal. We integrated our app with the Google Maps and Google Places APIs so that users can select eating locations from within the app.  We also integrated the login and sharing features with Facebook so that users did not have to manage a new set of friends just for this application. </p>\n" +

We wanted to create a fun activity that can be used on any big screen by multiple people; we envisioned it being used in a large open area where people are gathered like a festival or amusement park. Down Beat takes a song that is broken into 4 layers. Players use their bodies to control these layers. By moving faster, they speed up the tempo of their layers. By moving closer to the Kinect, they raise the volume of their layers. Additionally, there is a display of fireworks that is controlled by the same movements. Each player has a different color firework and they change volume and height based on movement.</p>\n" +

    "				<p>There are a multitude of places popping up on the internet for the purpose of eliciting and receiving help. Some of these are stand alone sites and others are communities within social sites, such as Reddit. When people are requesting monetary help online, many requests state that the requestor has helped others in the past or plans to help others in the future as part of the description. People that are donating frequently seek validation of who the requestor is from their activity on the site. However, there is no provided way for requestors to prove their previous donations or for those planning to give to see that activity. We wanted to research how a website could give requestors the ability to track their reciprocity, which we defined as the relationship between a user's giving and receiving. We also wanted to see if there was an impact on donations if this information was visible. We predicted that showing reciprocity would allow donors to quickly trust requestors which would help them make quicker decisions about donating and influence the amount they gave.</p>\n" +

    "				<p>After analyzing the results of the first survey and the feedback we received, we decided to use two of the top four statements to test further. In the first survey, all of the statements showed more giving than receiving, but we also wanted to test whether a positive reciprocity or a negative reciprocity statement would be more likely to get donations. We created a survey to test this and received 276 responses on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We randomly showed each Turk worker the request and then one visualization of reciprocity or a control showing only the request. We asked how much they would donate, and also recorded the amount of time it took them to answer. The only statistically significant result we found was those who donated spent longer thinking about their decision and as time increased, dollar amount increased as well. We also saw that people generally gave more to people who had given less than they received. The statement \"Martin has given to 20 people and received donations from 50 people\" (3rd card below) was most likely to receive higher amounts of money.</p>\n" +

    "		<p>The first step was to determine the content that was needed for this type of website and make sketch wireframes. While making these sketches, I focused on making the heirarchy consistent across the mobile and desktop versions of the website. I also concentrated on making the most important aspects of the website higher in the heirarchy. I decided that if someone was visiting a page like this, they would want to know who it was about, their title, and how to contact them; so I made that information easy to find at a glance. I also wanted it to be easy to look through examples of work and see a summary about the person, so I included that information on the home screen in the forms of a carousel showing work and a brief summary paragraph. I created 5 sketches of possible layouts and then picked the aspects I liked from each one to create a final sketch and use in future iterations.</p>\n" +
